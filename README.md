# ColdSteel
A badass hack for a game called Remnant: From the Ashes.

This hack is work in progress right now, you can refer to project files to see the progress.

# Development has been halted
Its ended. Not much features are not really developed.
Tho he directx12 hooking by abusing original SwapChain, Device and DeiceContext is still worth to leave as reference.

# if u want to taste this hack.

**:warning: Don't download via "Download ZIP"**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/s3pt3mb3r/ColdSteel.git --recursive
```

How it currently looks like.

Other feature could be made by now but I haven't done cuz it's silly and pointless.
